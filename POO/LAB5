Define a class CasNormal containing a method someMethod that displays "normal".
Define a class CaseSpecial containing a method someMethod which displays "special".
Finally define the function caseThatSuits with a parameter isNormal initialized by default to
True. If the parameter is checked, the function body returns an instance of the class
CasNormal, otherwise it returns an instance of the CasSpecial class.
In the main program, create the instance you want, then check its type by
calling the method someMethod on it.
